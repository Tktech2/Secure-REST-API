## Pre-requisite for developing  Technical Exercise
    1. The Base project is a WebAPI type of project. 

    2. Please use Postman for testing and firirng Web requests to secure API. Have used 
    	Visual Studio 2019 Community edition for C# development

    3.For securing the Web api, JWT Authentication is used. Hence target framework changed from 3.1 to 5.0
    	See attached screenshot- TargetFrameworkChanged.png
    
    4. JWT Authentication is used for securing API requests. Each token generated by API for logged in user
	will last for 20 minutes, post which if any request is made will be considered Unauthorzed (401).
	This value can be changed from App.Settings.json file under key- DurationInMinutes

    5. The JWT Configuration injection is done inside of StartUP class. Please install the nuget packages mentioned
    in next section

    6. All stepwise screenshots are also uploaded under folder ..\TestCases-Screenshots

## Setup
	Install following NuGet Packages below packages from  Package Manage Console under NuGet Menu of Tools:

        Install-Package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer
        Install-Package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.EntityFrameworkCore
        Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
        Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
        Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
        Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools
        Install-Package Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Design
        Install-Package System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt
 
## DB Migration
	1. For creating database, used  Code First Approach of Entity Framework Core.
	Connection String is stored in APP Settings.json:

    "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=DB2;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true"
  
    2. Before executing application, please run following commands on the Package Manager Console to apply migrations.

        add-migration "migration1"
        update-database
 

## Running with Postman
Start PostMan desktop utility to execute API requests in this order:
